title: Web3 Server
---

We are developing a clientside application server that can be used by Progressive Web Applications to remove centralized user information.

Our system provides a suite of restful HTTP and WebSocket endpoints that enhance PWA's with native app functionality and polyfills to override the underlying storage of localStorage, and sessionStorage to an encrypted dataspace.
